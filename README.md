Each symbol is named in it's file and it's dimensions are 150x150. SVG versions have
been optimized with SVGO already. PNG versions are black on transparent. JPG has been
compressed to 80% quality. And additionally there's a folder `JPG-ICO` that has 32px
sized jpeg versions at 50% quality for icon sampling.

They where designed on a grid based on 25px, with 4 subdivisions.
